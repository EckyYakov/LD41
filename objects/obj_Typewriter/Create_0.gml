They certainly would not be happy with me taking up precious space in the community garden. \n\n Little do they know, I'm actually a fine gardener myself. I water my plants when they need it and harvest them when they are fully grown! \n\n Some of these people neglect their plants for so long that they shrivel up and die, But not me! \n\n I'm sure once I have the product people will flock here to buy it. \n\n What could go wrong??"
