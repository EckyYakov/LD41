intructions = "This looks like a good place to GROW my business.\n\n The biggest thing I need to do is avoid is those pesky gardeners. They certainly would not be happy with me taking up precious space in the community garden. \n\n Little do they know, I'm actually a fine gardener myself, I water my plants when they need it and harvest them when they are fully grown! \n\n Some of these people neglect their plants for so long, they shrivvle up and die. But not me! \n\n I'm sure once I have the product people will flock to me to buy it. \n If they don't, then it's going to really slow me down carrying all these plants. \n\n Oh well, what could go wrong?"
